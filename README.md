# Energy Conservation Project 🌱

This project focuses on optimizing energy usage in homes using:
- 🔍 Sensor data (e.g., temperature, occupancy)
- 🧠 Machine Learning (for energy prediction & control)
- ⚙️ Hardware like ESP32, DHT11, PIR sensor

## Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Occupancy detection using PIR sensor
- Fan/AC control using ML/Q-learning
- Energy usage statistics & MQTT/ThingSpeak integration

## Technologies Used
- Python / Arduino / ESP32
- DHT11, PIR sensor, L298N motor driver
- Machine Learning (Q-learning)
- ThingSpeak for dashboard
